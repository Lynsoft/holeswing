# Development Workflow Setup Summary

This document summarizes the complete development workflow that has been configured for the Golf Field App.

## âœ… Completed Setup

### 1. Biome - Fast Formatter and Linter
- **Installed**: `@biomejs/biome` as dev dependency
- **Removed**: ESLint, Prettier, and related packages (eslint-config-expo, eslint-config-prettier, prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- **Configuration**: `biome.json` with React/TypeScript optimized settings
- **Features**:
  - Code formatting (replaces Prettier)
  - Linting (replaces ESLint)
  - Import organization
  - 2-space indentation, single quotes, 100 char line width
  - React-specific rules enabled
  - Security rules configured for Expo/React Native

### 2. Git Hooks with Husky
- **Installed**: `husky` and `lint-staged`
- **Pre-commit hook**: Runs Biome formatting and linting on staged files only
- **Pre-push hook**: Runs TypeScript checking and full Biome validation
- **Commit-msg hook**: Validates conventional commit message format
- **Configuration**: Optimized for fast execution with staged file processing

### 3. Automated Changelog Generation & Release Management
- **Installed**: `@commitlint/cli`, `@commitlint/config-conventional`, `conventional-changelog-cli`, `release-it`, `standard-version`
- **Commit validation**: Enforces conventional commit format
- **Changelog generation**: Automatic based on commit messages
- **Release tools**: Multiple options for different workflows
  - `release-it`: Interactive releases with GitHub integration
  - `standard-version`: Automated releases based on conventional commits
  - GitHub Actions: Automated and manual release workflows
- **Configuration**: `commitlint.config.js`, `.release-it.json`, `.versionrc.json`
- **Scripts**: Comprehensive release management commands

### 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  - Runs on PRs and pushes to main/develop
  - Lint and format checking with Biome
  - TypeScript validation
  - Build verification
  - Test execution (when available)
  - Artifact upload for web builds

- **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  - Triggered on version tags or manual dispatch
  - Quality checks before release
  - Automatic changelog generation
  - GitHub release creation with release notes
  - Build and optional deployment to GitHub Pages
  - Support for manual releases with version selection

- **Auto Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`):
  - Triggered on pushes to main branch
  - Analyzes commits for release-worthy changes
  - Automatically creates releases based on conventional commits
  - Supports major, minor, and patch releases

- **Dependabot Integration**:
  - Weekly dependency updates
  - Auto-merge for passing checks
  - Proper labeling and assignment

### 5. Package.json Scripts Integration
- **Updated scripts**:
  - `lint`: Run Biome linting checks
  - `lint:fix`: Fix Biome linting issues
  - `format`: Format code with Biome
  - `type-check`: TypeScript validation
  - `quality`: Combined type checking and linting
  - `quality:fix`: Fix linting issues and run type check

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files Created/Modified

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Project changelog
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit git hook
- `.husky/pre-push` - Pre-push git hook
- `.husky/commit-msg` - Commit message validation hook
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release workflow
- `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` - Automated release workflow
- `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` - Dependabot automation
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependabot configuration
- `.release-it.json` - Release-it configuration
- `.versionrc.json` - Standard-version configuration
- `RELEASE.md` - Comprehensive release management guide

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and lint-staged configuration, removed ESLint/Prettier dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced with development tool exclusions
- `utils/supabase.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors

### Removed Files
- `eslint.config.js` - No longer needed (replaced by Biome)
- `prettier.config.js` - No longer needed (replaced by Biome)

## ðŸš€ Workflow Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Consistent formatting**: Automatic code formatting on commit with Biome
- **Linting**: Comprehensive code quality checks with Biome (faster than ESLint)
- **Type safety**: TypeScript validation in CI/CD
- **Import organization**: Automatic import sorting with Biome

### Developer Experience
- **Fast tools**: Biome is significantly faster than ESLint + Prettier (single tool vs multiple)
- **Simplified toolchain**: One tool (Biome) instead of multiple (ESLint + Prettier + plugins)
- **Pre-commit validation**: Catch issues before they reach the repository
- **Conventional commits**: Structured commit messages for better history
- **Automated changelog**: Release notes generated from commits

### CI/CD Integration
- **Quality gates**: Prevent merging of low-quality code
- **Automated builds**: Verify application builds successfully
- **Dependency management**: Automated updates with quality checks
- **Release automation**: Streamlined release process

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development
pnpm start

# Check code quality
pnpm run quality

# Fix formatting and linting issues
pnpm run quality:fix

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Release Process
```bash
# Interactive release (recommended)
pnpm run release

# Automated release based on commits
pnpm run standard-version

# Specific version releases
pnpm run release:patch    # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1
pnpm run release:minor    # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0
pnpm run release:major    # 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0

# Preview changes
pnpm run release:dry
```

### Quality Checks
- **Pre-commit**: Automatically runs on `git commit`
- **Pre-push**: Automatically runs on `git push`
- **CI**: Runs on every PR and push to main/develop
- **Manual**: Use `pnpm run quality` anytime

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up `.env` file with Supabase credentials
2. **Testing**: Add test framework (Jest/React Native Testing Library)
3. **Deployment**: Configure production deployment targets
4. **Documentation**: Add API documentation and component stories
5. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and analytics

The development workflow is now fully configured and ready for productive development with automated quality enforcement and streamlined release processes.
